ForgeYourParents.com

ForgeYourParents.com is a humorous and fictional web application that explores creative roleplay scenarios for college students. The platform allows users to book actors to portray parents or guardians for mock college meetings, disciplinary simulations, or practice conversations. This project is built purely for fun, learning, and experimentation with full stack web development concepts.

This is not a real service and does not promote deception or illegal activity. The project focuses on storytelling, UI design, and system architecture.

Project Idea

College students often face stressful interactions such as parent teacher meetings, disciplinary warnings, or academic reviews. ForgeYourParents.com turns this anxiety into a lighthearted roleplay experience where users can simulate these situations in a safe and fictional environment.

The core goal is to build a complete web application while learning real world development skills.
